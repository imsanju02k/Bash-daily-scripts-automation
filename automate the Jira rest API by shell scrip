Create an API Token
If you haven't already, you'll need to generate an API token from your Atlassian account. This token is used instead of your password for authentication.
Log in to https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens.
Click on 'Create API token'.
Give your token a meaningful name, then click 'Create'.
Copy the token to a secure location. You won't be able to see it again.
